# __INTRODUCTION__

With the climate rapidly changing and humans having increasing impact on global ecosystems, today it is not longer sufficient to classify and analyse ecosystems based on their geographical location. In this study we aim to seek factors to classify ecosystems based on their wider geoecological parameters. The goal is to create a classifier that allows us to dynamically classify ecosystems to predict expected values as i.e. species richness, species extinction rates, soil status, soil detioration and eventually ecosystem collapse <br>
