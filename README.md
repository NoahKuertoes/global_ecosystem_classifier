# __INTRODUCTION__

With the climate rapidly changing and humans having increasing impact on global ecosystems, today it is not longer sufficient to classify and analyse ecosystems based on their geographical location. In this study we aim to seek factors to classify ecosystems based on their wider geoecological parameters. The goal is to create a classifier that allows us to dynamically classify ecosystems to predict expected values as i.e. species richness, species extinction rates, soil status, soil detioration and eventually ecosystem collapse <br>

### Project objective

**Minimal viable product (MVP):** [Website](link.to.website) that shows the development of ecosystems over time.

**Goal:** Showing a trend of ecosystem development and migration over time

**Validation:** Highlighting renaturation efforts of the past decade such as [Great Green Wall Initiative](https://www.unccd.int/our-work/ggwi), [Chinese Loess Plateau Rehabilitation](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/dsd/dsd_aofw_mg/mg_success_stories/csd8/SARD-16.htm) and the [Netherlands’ Marker Wadden](https://www.ecoshape.org/en/cases/marker-wadden/)



### Disclaimer

This project is designed and pursued in the context of the *Data Analytics Consulting Bootcamp 2024-2* from *neuefische GmbH*. During which a capstone project is to be designed for the timeframe of four weeks, including setup, data retrieval, analysis and integration.
