## Introduction

This document refers to the usage of the [GLDAS Noah Land Surface Model L4 monthly 0.25 x 0.25 degree V2.1 (GLDAS_NOAH025_M)](https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/datasets/GLDAS_NOAH025_M_2.1/summary). For more detailed information refer to the projects [README](https://hydro1.gesdisc.eosdis.nasa.gov/data/GLDAS/GLDAS_NOAH025_M.2.1/doc/README_GLDAS2.pdf)

GLDAS-2 has three versions: 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2, which use different weather data sources and methods for processing. GLDAS-2.1, updated in 2020, replaced the older GLDAS-1 and now provides monthly land data corrected with a new land mask. It uses combined weather information from sources like [NOAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration) and [GPCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Precipitation_Climatology_Project), starting from the year 2000.
